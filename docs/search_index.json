The first dataset we are going to use is related with the sales of a shop from September 2023 until September 2024, and the main idea is to look for the principal income of the shop, from which item we can obtain more money or which is the less bought item . The second dataset is related with the workers of data and HR-department of an industry, we can look for important resources such us Gender, Years at the Company, Job Level and the income of the worker. 1.1 Plotting amounts We want to see the amount of money earned in the store with the different products offered. With this, although we would still need to analyze the price we pay to have that product in the store, we can consider which product brings us the most money and which one brings us the least. For this we first group the colums Product type and we sum the total price of that product and, after that, we separate it into the different categories for the barplot. It is also important to know which payment methods generate the most profit for us in order to identify those associated with higher purchase amounts. To do this, we calculated the mean and the median, since the mean can be affected by outliers, while the median is more robust. Thanks to this, we observed that the methods with the highest spending per purchase are PayPal and bank transfer. However, we can also see how outliers affect the mean, as it increases relatively compared to the median by about 250 per sale. 1.2 Proportions Another important data that we should work with it is the different shipping methods in the store. So we consider that a pie chart is suitable for the case. In the graph we can see that the most used method is the “Standard” with about 33.6% of the shipping. However we can observe that the other faster methods are balanced with about 16% each. This gives us the conclusion that customers prefer the cheapest shipping methods despite that the others are faster than the Standar. Now we should look for the most sold products (not the ones that gives us the more income) and we can relate with the first graph. As we can observe, the most sold item are smartphones that matches with the first graph. We can also see that tablet, laptop and smart watch are really similar, however the one that produces the second better income are the smart watches while here we can see that the second most sold item are the tablets. Finally the less sold item are the headphones which are also the items with the less income. 1.3 Distributions Now we will analyse the different purchases by men and women. In this graph we can see that the sales are balanced between them and we can not observe big difference in any product. The smartphone continues to be the most sold item despite of the gender with approximately 3000 sales from each gender. We can observe a little difference in the headphones, where men tends to buy more than women, however women tends to buy more smatwatches. ## Trends 1.4 Distributions 2 ## Visualizing uncertaintly "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
